![System XVI Logo](doc/logotype_variant.png)

### Overview
System XVI is a modern take on service management.
It aims to incorporate useful functionality while maintaining a modular 
design in the UNIX tradition.

### Development

##### Building
System XVI uses kBuild (as used in VirtualBox, etc).
There are minimal dependencies: you need procps and libkqueue in their 
development formats. 
Then just install your distro's package for kBuild (probably called 
kbuild) and run kmk.

##### Licence
System XVI is free software. You may use it and its source code under the 
terms of the GPL version 3.0 or (at your option) any later version.
